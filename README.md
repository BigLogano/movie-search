Movie App (Work in Progress)
This is a simple movie discovery app I started by following a tutorial. The base version lets you search for movies and browse through popular ones using data from the TMDb API. I’m planning to build on top of it and turn it into a more complete project for my portfolio.

What It Does (Right Now)
Lets you search for movies by title

Shows a list of popular movies

Displays posters, titles, and a little info for each movie

There’s a favorite button on each movie card, but it doesn’t actually do anything yet

Tech Stack
React for the frontend

JavaScript

CSS

TMDb API for the movie data

Plans for Improvement
Make the favorite/watchlist feature work (local storage or database)

Add user login so people can save stuff

Improve the UI with better design and responsiveness

Build a personalized recommendation system

Possibly add JustWatch or Letterboxd integration
